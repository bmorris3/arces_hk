Workflow
========

* Add star directories and names to `mwo.py`, then run it
* Add dates and names to `hat11.py`, then run it
* Run `calibrate.py` to determine the APO-MWO calibration constants
* Run `plot_calibrated_hat11.py` to see the calibrated HAT-P-11 S-indices
* Run `plot_calibrated_k2.py` to see the calibrated K2 target S-indices
